# MYOT
## Roberto Aureli

A space colonization based tool that generates tree of various types.
The project is heavely based on [Yocto/GL](https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl) and follows the concept on the [Modeling Trees with a Space Colonization Algorithm](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/colonization.egwnp2007.large.pdf) paper.

___________________________________

## Implementation

Following the Yocto philosophy, a tree is seen as a Shape.
Starting from a point given by the user, the branches grow to reach a  cloud of attractors (points) scattered in the space following a known rule.\
Contrarily to the paper, Voronoi's set are not used but, for semplicity (at cost of performances), only a distance function is taken from Yocto to map the set of active attractors with respect to a growing branch.

An attractor is *active* when its sphere of influence contains a tree node that is growing.\
An attractor is *dead* (and then removed from the cloud) when it's under a certain distance from a node.

Starting from a generic tree node, the growth direction is decided by the average of the positions of active attractors in regard to that node. The length is a parameter.

Every node is considered in the growing loop untile no more attractor are alive or a certain number of branches is reached.

Initially a branch is a line that is then evolved to a mesh. The latter is a cylinder with an emisphere at the top used to fill the "holes" in the meshes that can be caused by the high angle of attack between two adiacent branches.\
The width of a branch is given by the *Da Vinci's formula* that put in relations the n-th power of the width of a parent branch to the n-th power of the widths of the childs. \
To keep track of every width, a matrix is built after traversing all the tree.\
A further loop is finally executed along all the final branches to add leaves following a *Logaritmic Spiral Distribution*.

## Usage

There is a plenty of parameters to decide the shape of a generic tree so, for the command line interface, only a little part of them is editable by the user (while in the main function everything is editable and commented to fine tune the tree).
Thanks to Yocto, there are two possible format to export the tree and the selection is really easy: just set *-o* <path name extension> to *.json* or *.obj* . With the JSON format the scene is populated with PLY objects.\
Make sure that the folder in which you want to save already exists.

### JSON settings

It is possible to set several parameters from the CLI. However, if you want to fine tune your tree, you can call the program with the *-j* (or *--json*) option and add the path to a *json* configuration file. 
The file *configuration.json* contains all the parameters.

### Single model mode

    -s true -t < 1|2|3 > --s-textures <path> --s-textures-opacity <path> ...

This mode helps with keeping everything in a compact way. A single texture is mapped over the trunk and the leaves giving the possibility to use up to 3 differents textures for the latter.
Following a clockwise disposition, the leaves textures need to be displaced in the right order to be taken by the software. 
The first frame is for the trunk texture.

### Multiple models mode

    -s false --m-trunk-texture <path> --m-leaves-textures <path> --m-leaves-textures-opacity <path> -t <N> 

With multiple models, the generator will return one object for the trunk and *N* different objects for the leaves. Every leaves object is mapped to one of the *N* textures.\
There are some rules to follow to build a tree with this modality regarding the naming of the leaves textures.\
Name the texture with a final number that starts from 0 and goes to *N*-1 but does not include it in the *--m-leaves-textures* and *--m-leaves-textures-opacity* paths.\
Example:

> File on the disk:
>>trunk.png\
>>leaf_0.png\
>>leaf_1.png\
>>leaf_opacity_0.png\
>>leaf_opacity_1.png

> Parameters:
>>     -s false --m-trunk-texture "./trunk" --m-leaves-textures "./leaf_" --m-leaves-textures-opacity "./leaf_opacity_" -t 2 ...

Make sure to map exactly the index of the color texture to the one of the opacity texture.

There are two things that needs a little bit of attention when building a tree from scratches: 
1. Make sure that at least one attractor from the attractors cloud is within the *--influence-sphere* from the trunk
1. Is it possible to crash the program when chosing a trunk length that is not feasible: try a number that is divisible by *-D*
1. *--influence-sphere* and *--killing-radius* are strictly dependant on the given cloud shape, yielding really ugly trees if set wrong.

The run.sh helps by automatically generating a tree (loading the parameters from the tree_try.json) and displaying it using Yocto ysceneitrace.

### Leaves textures

In every modality, the texture of every leaf has one constraint: it should be oriented rotated by 45Â° as in the following picture.

## Performances

The code is not time optimized: it's a non-parallel implementation with simple math concepts, excluding structures (like Voronoi's) that could have improved the execution.
Nevertheless, even for a big tree, the time elapsed is accetable.
In the following table, a series of examples shows the time used to build and save the tree.
All the tree shares the same parameters but not the same number of branches.
With 10000 attractors: 

| Tree Branches | Single Mode | Multi Mode |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 500           | 0.2784s     | 0.4762s    |
| 2500          | 0.8008s     | 0.9821s    |
| 3309          | 1.0681s     | 1.2493s    |
| 5000*         | 6.0347s     | 6.2874s    |

*Limit of 3309 branches reached beacuse all the attractors were destroyed.
To reach 5000 branches is necessary to increase drammatically the number of attractors (from 10000 to 75000), hence the big time jump.
Note that the attractors generation process, even with 75000 attractors, took no more than 0.02 seconds.


## Examples

These are some trees build with the tree_generator and rendered with Yocto.
All the resources are taken from [textures.com](http://textures.com)

### Spherical tree 

    -n 10000 -b 5000 --trunk-length 3 -f 0 -z 5 -M 10 -m -10
![Tree N.1 ](img/1.png)

### Strange rotational solid tree

    -n 1000 -b 1000 --trunk-length 1 -f 1 -z 0 -M 10 -m -10 -s 0 -t 1
![Tree N.2 ](img/2.png)



### Same rotational solid as before

![Oak ](img/quercia.jpg)
![Oak closeup](img/quercia_closeup.jpg)

This is a better scene (with directional lights) than the one in the previous renders with a closeup to show better how the leaves are arranged.

### A tree climbing a wall
![Climbing](img/wall_1.png)
![Climbing](img/wall_tree_2.png)

This tree grows attracted by a set of attractors that are distributed in a plane (with a minimal width)


### Dwarf Maple
![Dwarf Maple](img/nano.png)

This dwarf Maple is embedded in a cylinder and has three different types of leaves.

### Example scene composed in Blender

Finally, to show how Yocto handles the exports of a generic shape, a Tree is exported in OBJ extension and then put in a scene with Blender
(Environment texture taken from [HDRIhaven](https://hdrihaven.com/)):
